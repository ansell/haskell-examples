## Book

Following the ``Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!`` book from http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters

## Install Haskell

```bash
sudo apt-get install haskell-platform
```

## Get version

```bash
ghc --version
```

returns the following for me:

```
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 7.10.3
```

## Loading into ghci

When loading a file into ghci you need to use ``:l``, not ``:1`` as the font in the book can be interpreted.
